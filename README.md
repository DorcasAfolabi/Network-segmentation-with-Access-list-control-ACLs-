# Network Segmentation with ACL Control (Case study) 
I designed a secure internal network for improved operational efficiency for catnork technologies ltd

# Project Overview
This project showcases a detailed functional internal network simulated for catnork technologies using cisco packect tracer featuring a routing protocol, switches, desktop PCs, a laptop used by an engineer, DHCP and DNS server and a web server hosting the internal company site. devices are grouped across departments and connected through different switches, with all traffic routed through a central router.After building the network with all necessary devices and services, Access Control List (ACL) was configured on the router to ensure that only the engineering laptop can access the webserver via HTTP. All other devices were restricted from HTTP access to the webserver but maintained access to other network services.

# key Objectives
As the Network Security Administrator at Catnork Technologies, I was responsible for designing and deploying a fully functional and secure enterprise network. This included the selection, installation, and configuration of all necessary networking devices and services to ensure optimal performance and scalability.

A key security objective of the project involved implementing an Extended Access Control List (ACL) on the core router to enforce selective access control. Specifically, I configured the ACL to permit only the engineering departmentâ€™s laptop to access the internal web server via HTTP (port 80). All other devices across the network were explicitly denied HTTP access to the web server, while still maintaining access to other essential services such as DNS, email, file sharing, and internal applications.

This implementation enhanced the security posture of the network by ensuring principle of least privilege and controlled access to critical resources, without disrupting business operations or service availability.
